All models (with the same input size of
1, 600 × 800 and the backbone network of ResNet-50) were
trained on NVIDIA RTX3090 GPUs using the Adam optimizer
with a learning rate of 0.0001, decaying every epoch with
an exponential rate of 0.96. The total number of epochs was
50, and the batch size was 1.
